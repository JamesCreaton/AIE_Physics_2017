# README #

This repository contains the work that I have completed at Academy of Interactive Entertainment for my second year programming assessments. The project has a basic OpenGL engine that is able to load shaders from file in .vert and .frag format 
and 3D models in .obj format. There is a basic flycamera class that allows you to move around the scene with wasd and
mouse input. The Physics library contains collision detection and resoultion for sphere, AABB and place objects with
quite fast response, tested with a plane and 100 objects of sphere and AABB type with decent performace.

### What is this repository for? ###

The main use of this repository is to have an online backup of my programming work
and an example of my knowledge.

### How do I get set up? ####

The only setup that should be required is setting the envrioment to be run in x86. All of the dependencies are contained
in the deps folder.

### Who do I talk to? ###
